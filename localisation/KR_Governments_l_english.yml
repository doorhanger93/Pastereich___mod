marxist_subtype_desc:0 "Marxists are the orthodox followers of Marx. They espouse the need for the workers to rise up in a violent revolution to destroy the bourgeois state and to establish in its stead a strong democratic state in which to build socialism, typically supporting a planned economy and fairly centralised authority."
syndicalist_subtype_desc:0 "\"Revolutionary Socialists\" make up a variety of movements that call for a violent revolution against capitalism, but that don't agree with orthodox Marxist doctrine's strong state and planned economy, among other things. Such movements include: Anarchism, in which no socialist state is build up and a stateless socialist society is formed immediately, Syndicalism, a form of socialism in which trade unions form the basic economic and political units of society, typically with a highly decentralised state or no state at all, and various Market Socialist movements, in which the socialist economy is comprised of a market between worker-owned businesses, typically with a decentralised state."
radical_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Democratic Socialists differentiate themselves from other socialists by not calling for a violent revolution, instead trying to reform the capitalist state from the inside via participation in the existing democratic system. Some aim to merely weaken the capitalist state and eventually enable a peaceful revolution, whereas others hope to reform all the way to a fully socialist state."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanise it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a plutocratic form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Social liberalism is a variation on mainstream Market liberalism, with the main difference being the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of their status."
market_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Market liberals see themselves as the mainstream liberal ideology. The main tenants of Market liberalism are an unregulated free market and a democratic plutocratic political system. Market liberals believe that the freer the market the freer the people, and they will staunchly defend the political and economic rights of the individual."
social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Conservatism is a political ideology centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society in order and stable. Usually they promote a regulated market economy, but more liberal economic policies aren't unheard of."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian democracy is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partial democratic political system. Authoritarian democratic regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues and promote liberal-capitalist economies with limited state intervention. The aim of these regimes are to maintain national stability and provide the people both a popular and responsible government."
paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a monarch or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state controlled economy."
national_populist_subtype_desc:0 "Encompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy. Often espousing racial politics and violent rhetoric, National Populism is vehemently opposed by most other political parties."
